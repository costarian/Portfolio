# Portfolio
This portfolio is my personal projects made as a front-end developer using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and its framework like React.js.
This is a random quote machine I built and it purpose is to fetch quote data made by people around the world from API source. 
These over thousands quotes are generated randomly when a button is clicked. The entire project is created using React.js
